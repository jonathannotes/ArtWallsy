# ArtWallsy drop‑in (BETA)

This zip contains the HTML/CSS/JS only. Drop your assets into the folders below using *exact* filenames:

```
assets/frames/black.png
assets/frames/white.png
assets/frames/gold.png
assets/frames/silver.png
assets/frames/oak.png

assets/rooms/bedroom.jpg
assets/rooms/livingroom.jpg
assets/rooms/hallway.jpg
```

Then open `index.html` locally or deploy to Vercel/Netlify. The app is mobile‑first and clips the artwork inside the frame opening with a white mat toggle.
