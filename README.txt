ArtWallsy — Frames Only Pack (v6.3)

This ZIP only replaces the frame assets. Nothing else changes.
Order: Black → White → Gold → Silver → Oak (matches your current UI).

Install (Vercel + GitHub):
1) In your repo, go to /assets/frames/ and delete existing frame PNGs.
2) Upload the five PNGs from this ZIP into /assets/frames/:
   - black.png
   - white.png
   - gold.png
   - silver.png
   - oak.png
   (And their @2x variants are included; keep the same names.)
3) Commit to main and redeploy on Vercel (it auto‑deploys).
4) Hard refresh your site (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac / Ctrl+F5 on Windows).

If your code references different file names:
- Update your imports/paths to the ones above, or rename these files to match.
A manifest.json is included if you want to enforce the order in code.
